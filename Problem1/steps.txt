1- Encoding: -1 for local, -2 for cloud, 0 to M-1 task
2- select population length (L)
3- select top K% fittest (elite) based on task completion time
4- These K will be passed to the next generation.
5- From these K selected population, we will generate (100-K)% of the population children
6- From the K values, randomly select 2 random parents.
7- from these parents, perform cross selection based on a random threshold, CHECK VALID? If no repeat.
8- perform mutation, CHECK VALID? If yes, accept it in the next population, if no, repeat.
9- repeat steps 5 to 8, until filling the population.
10- Check stoping criteria, stop if met, otherwise repeat steps 3 to 10.
